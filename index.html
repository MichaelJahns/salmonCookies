        <fieldset> Our Story</fieldset>
        <p> Have you ever wanted to roll the dice? Live life on the absolute edge? Play fast and easy with your life? Our founder Pam Herra did. Thats why she decided to add salmonella risk to her morning routine. </p>
        <p> Somehow, denying all logic and convention, she's made a business out of it, and all of us at Pam's Questionable Confections are complicit. Without a food handlers license, Pam's Questionable Confections has locations at 1st and Pike, SeaTac Airpor, the Seattle Center, Capitol Hill, and Akli.</p>
        <p> If you've got a stomach of steel (and are willing to sign a 13 page liability Waiver), come on down!</p>
